Pattern recognition for a quantum circuit

Input: 
    - Circuit
    - Number of qubits in quantum processor
    - Pattern length

Algorithm:
    - define an initial string
    - assign every distinct pair of qubits a unique id
        - unique id = first argument * number of qubits in processor + second argument
    - concatinate all the ids. this gives you the initial string
        - ex: s = (45 87 63) 81 45 19 57 10 45 87 63 45 19 57 45 87 63
    - given pattern length l, find the repetitive substrings of length l in the string s
        - construct a dictionary of substrings of length l as key and the number of times
        they are seen in s as the value.
    - return a dictionary where the key is the pattern and the value is a dictionary
     that has two values
        - count: the number of times it was repeated >= 2.
        - locations: an array of indeces where the pattern occurred
